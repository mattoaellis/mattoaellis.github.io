 abstract = {Using the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch (LLB) equation for ferromagnetic materials, we derive analytic expressions for temperature dependent absorption spectra as probed by ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). By analysing the resulting expressions, we can predict the variation of the resonance frequency and damping with temperature and coupling to the thermal bath. We base our calculations on the technologically relevant L1\$_0\$ FePt, parameterised from atomistic spin dynamics simulations, with the Hamiltonian mapped from ab-initio parameters. By constructing a multi-macrospin model based on the LLB equation and exploiting GPU acceleration we extend the study to investigate the effects on the damping and resonance frequency in \$\\backslashmu\\$m sized structures.},
