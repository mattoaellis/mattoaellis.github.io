      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was nice early Christmas present that we heard that two of our recent submissions had been accepted.
The first was invited article in Frontiers in Applied Mathematics and Statistics where we have been looking
at hierarchical (or deep) echo state networks and how we can tune them to exhibit multiple timescales.
The abstract is available on the Frontiers &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fams.2020.616658/abstract&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt; and the full article should be available soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second was a collaboration with the University of York that has been ongoing since my PhD. This is developing a combined model of spin and moelcular dynamics which are
simulated concurrently. A few models of spin-lattice dynamics have been proposed already but here we present some novel results of the Gilbert damping caused by the coupling
of the spin system to lattice. This is a very interesting topic and we will be using our model to explore spin-lattice dynamics in the future. Whilst the article is not yet out
at Physical Review B, the pre-print can be found on Arxiv &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00642&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
