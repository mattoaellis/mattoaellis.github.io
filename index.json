However, the mechanism that drives the magnetization switching in ferromagnets is unclear. Recent theories suggest that the interaction of the light with the magnetized media induces an opto-magnetic field within the media, known as the inverse Faraday effect. Here we show that an alternative mechanism, driven by thermal excitation over the anisotropy energy barrier and a difference in the energy absorption depending on polarization, can create a net magnetization over a series of laser pulses in an ensemble of single domain grains. Only a small difference in the absorption is required to reach magnetization levels observed experimentally and the model does not preclude the role of the inverse Faraday effect but removes the necessity that the opto-magnetic field is 10s of Tesla in strength.","tags":null,"title":"All-optical switching in granular ferromagnets caused by magnetic circular dichroism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M O A Ellis","R W Chantrell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"d23d294220c0bbba956bf1bc9eefaef7","permalink":"https://mattoaellis.github.io/publication/ellis-2015-fe-pt/","publishdate":"2019-12-13T14:25:44.978266Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ellis-2015-fe-pt/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Switching times of nanoscale FePt: Finite size effects on the linear reversal mechanism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

By analysing the resulting expressions, we can predict the variation of the resonance frequency and damping with temperature and coupling to the thermal bath. We base our calculations on the technologically relevant L1$_0$ FePt, parameterised from atomistic spin dynamics simulations, with the Hamiltonian mapped from ab-initio parameters. By constructing a multi-macrospin model based on the LLB equation and exploiting GPU acceleration we extend the study to investigate the effects on the damping and resonance frequency in $backslashmu$m sized structures.","tags":null,"title":"Temperature-dependent ferromagnetic resonance via the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation: Application to FePt","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R F L Evans","W J Fan","P Chureemart","T.
