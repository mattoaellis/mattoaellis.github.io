In the ordered FePt structure the normally nonmagnetic Pt ion acquires a magnetic moment, which depends on the local field originating from the neighboring Fe atoms. In this work a model of FePt is constructed in which the induced Pt moment is simulated by using combined longitudinal and rotational spin dynamics. The model is parameterized to include a linear variation of the moment with the exchange field, so that at the Pt site the magnetic moment depends on the Fe ordering. The Curie temperature of FePt is calculated and agrees well with similar models that incorporate the Pt dynamics through an effective Fe-only Hamiltonian. By computing the dynamic correlation function the anisotropy field and the Gilbert damping are extracted over a range of temperatures. The anisotropy exhibits a power-law dependence on the magnetization with exponent nâ‰ˆ2.1. This agrees well with what was observed experimentally, and it is obtained without including a two-ion anisotropy term as in other approaches. Our work shows that incorporating longitudinal fluctuations into spin dynamics calculations is crucial for understanding the properties of materials with induced moments.","tags":["FePt","Atomistic Spin Dynamics","Longituindal Dynamics","Ferromagnetic Resonance"],"title":"Role of longitudinal fluctuations in L10 FePt","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

However, the mechanism that drives the magnetization switching in ferromagnets is unclear. Recent theories suggest that the interaction of the light with the magnetized media induces an opto-magnetic field within the media, known as the inverse Faraday effect. Here we show that an alternative mechanism, driven by thermal excitation over the anisotropy energy barrier and a difference in the energy absorption depending on polarization, can create a net magnetization over a series of laser pulses in an ensemble of single domain grains. Only a small difference in the absorption is required to reach magnetization levels observed experimentally and the model does not preclude the role of the inverse Faraday effect but removes the necessity that the opto-magnetic field is 10s of Tesla in strength.","tags":["All optical switching","FePt","Granular recording media"],"title":"All-optical switching in granular ferromagnets caused by magnetic circular dichroism","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Machine learning, or the ability of computers to intelligently analyse complex data sets, may be the defining technology of our age. Society produces huge amounts of data in areas as diverse as economics, weather, medicine, science and social media, analysis of which can greatly enhance our decision making. However, current computers are poorly suited to analysing large and complex datasets, particularly when compared to animal and human brains.\nFor example, while a typical contemporary computer can perform simple numerical calculations much more quickly than the brain, its efficiency is almost one million times lower when performing more complex data analysis such as recognising human faces. This inefficiency results from attempts to emulate \u0026ldquo;neuromorphic\u0026rdquo;, or brain-like, computational processes by brute force on hardware which is ill-suited to the task. For example, in a conventional computer memory and processing are inherently separated, whereas they share the same medium in the brain. To overcome these limitations, bespoke computers that are specifically designed for neuromorphic computation are required.\nAway from pure computational power, the \u0026ldquo;big data\u0026rdquo; revolution has been driven by our ability to store information. This is the result of nano-scale magnetic technology in the form of hard-disk drives. However, nanomagnetic devices suffer from an encroaching limitation, in that their behaviour becomes increasingly unreliable, or stochastic, as they are further miniaturised to increase performance. While this is devastating for conventional digital computers, there is strong evidence that stochastic behaviour can be tolerated in, or even enhance, the performance of neuromorphic technologies. This raises the tantalising prospect of nanomagnetic technology being ideally suited for developing new computer forms of computer hardware for data analysis.\nIn this project, a collaboration between experts in nanomagnetic technology and computer science at the University of Sheffield, we will perform a pilot study to investigate whether stochastic behaviour in \u0026ldquo;magnetic domain wall devices\u0026rdquo; a promising form of magnetic nanotechnology where magnetic information is flowed through nanowire conduits, can be used to realise new, neuromorphic computer architectures. Working with an advisory board of academic and industry experts in machine learning technology we will demonstrate new data analysis devices, before creating a roadmap to develop the devices into real technology. Eventual success in developing these technologies could result in powerful hardware platforms that can provide even the smallest device the ability to intelligently analyse its environment to make informed decisions.\nCredit: Tom Hayward, Dan Allwood and Eleni Vasilaki\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"3ef1a62c271996106f7bd902820f0fcf","permalink":"https://mattoaellis.github.io/project/stochastics/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/stochastics/","section":"project","summary":"Machine learning with magnetic hardware","tags":["Machine Learning"],"title":"From Stochasticity to Functionality","type":"project"},{"authors":["Matthew O.
